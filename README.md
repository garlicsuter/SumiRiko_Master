#### Scene Needs:

- [x] Factory scene, optimized for VR
- [x] In-scene Debug Log Canvas
- [ ] Debug Log Canvas needs frames per second (fps) added
- [ ] Assembly line machinery
- [ ] Prefab of part to inspect (3 versions: Good, Bad (needs rubber hole opened with tool), and Bad (Non salvagable, toss in red garbage bin)
- [ ] Red garbage bin
- [ ] sharp poker tool (for clearing out parts with rubber hole obstructions)

Script needs:
- [ ] Part can only be oriented the correct way when placing on the assembly line. Script detects this and makes the socket mesh (translucent) red or green accordingly
